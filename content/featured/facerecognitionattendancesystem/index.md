Developed an entire full stack website where attendance can be tracked by facial recognition and for recognizing faces, open source library called faceapi.js. Features like search with filters, show analytics, and view attendance are also included in the website. Used ajax to communicate with servers to exchange variables between javascript and server to avoid reloading web-pages.
